# Motor Tren Car Road Analysis
## Executive Summary

You work for Motor Trend, a magazine about the automobile industry. Looking at a data set of a collection of cars, they are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome). They are particularly interested in whether:

1. An automatic or manual transmission is better for MPG, and
2. If the difference in MPG can be quantified between automatic and manual transmissions

## Data Processing

The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models).
This is stored in the ```mtcars``` dataset.
```{r echo=TRUE}
library(datasets)
data(mtcars)
```
It consists of 32 observations on 11 variables:
1. mpg Miles per (US) gallon
2. cyl Number of cylinders
3. disp Displacement (in cubic inches)
4. hp Gross horsepower
5. drat Rear axle ratio
6. wt Weight (lb/1000)
7. qsec 1/4 mile time
8. vs V/S
9. am Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)
10. gear Number of forward gears
11. carb Number of carburetors
```{r echo=TRUE}
summary(mtcars)
```
## Exploratory Data Analysis
Begin this exploration with a pairwise scatter plot between all variables.
```{r echo=TRUE}
pairs(mtcars)
```
Then, with the distribution of the dependent variable mpg, assess if it meets assumptions of regression. For this test, a histogram and kernel density would be apropos.
```{r echo=TRUE}
par(mfrow=c(2,1))
hist(mtcars$mpg, breaks=10, xlab="MPG", main="MPG histogram")
plot(density(mtcars$mpg), main="Kernel density", xlab="MPG")
```
It appears that the data is approximately normal, or perhaps right skewed.
### Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG?
First, some dissonance between the two transmission types. A quick summary to follow.
Automatic:
```{r echo=TRUE}
summary(mtcars[mtcars$am == 0,])
```
Manual:
```{r echo=TRUE}
summary(mtcars[mtcars$am == 1,])
```
Create a boxplot of MPG by transmission types.
```{r echo=TRUE}
boxplot(mpg ~ am,
	data = mtcars,
	xlab = "Transmission",
	ylab = "Miles per Gallon",
	main = "MPG by Transmission Type",
	names = c("Automatic", "Manual")
)
```
Ostensibly, given that the mean of manual is higher than that of automatic transmissions, we have a good hypothesis that manuals get better mileage than automatic transmissions.
A t-test is appropriate here:
```{r echo=TRUE}
t.test(mtcars$mpg ~ mtcars$am, conf.level=0.95)
```
